A minimal geometric logomark that evokes the feeling of one calm point of control directing an entire fleet into formation. The emotion is quiet authority — the moment chaos becomes order. One signal, and everything falls into place.

THE MARK: An abstract arrangement where a single element commands or organizes multiple smaller elements into precise formation. Not scattered — aligned. Not decorative — purposeful. The relationship between the one and the many is the entire concept. Think of the shape a flock makes when it finds its leader, or the geometry of a fleet moving as one.

THE STYLE: Flat, geometric, no more than 2-3 shapes. Solid purple #6C63FF on white background, no gradients, no glow, no outlines. The kind of mark you'd see etched into a CLI tool's man page. Must read clearly at favicon size.

THE MOOD: Quiet confidence. Not aggressive, not flashy. The feeling an engineer gets when they run one command and everything just works.

DO NOT: Include any text, letters, or words. No brains, no circuits, no robots, no AI clichés. No swooshes, no hexagons, no generic tech shapes. No blue. No complexity — if it has more than 5 elements it's too many.
